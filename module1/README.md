# Module 1 - Software Development LifeCycle SDLC



## What is Softeare Engineering?

### Objectives

* Define Software Engineering
* List the responsibilities of a software engineer
* Compare and contrast the role of software engineer to software developer

### Definition

    Software engineering is the application of scientific principles to the design and creation
    of software.
    The field uses a systematic approach to collect and analyze business requirements in order
    to design, build, and test software applications to satisfy those business requirements. 


    - Kedasha Kerr
        What is software engineering??

        - Using programming languages and engineering principles to build products
        - Software Engineering can be a broad term
        - Different types of engineers

        What is the difference between a software developer and a software engineer??

        - Trained as full stack developer but worked on front-end
        - May be a matter of semantics
        - Gatekeeping
        - Title changes and title differences
        - Depends on the particular company
        - All using same tools and technology
        
    - Liseidy Bueno
        What is software engineering??
    
        - Building and improving software
        - Design architecture to user interface to fixing bugs
    
        What is the difference between a software developer and a software engineer??

        - Sometimes terms are used interchangeably
        - Software engineers are responsible for system design and architecture
        - Software developers are focused more on building code
    
    - Tommy Young
        What is software engineering??

        - A creative process
        - Practice of designing, envisioning implementing, and then supporting and maintaining software through the full lifecycle
    
        What is the difference between a software developer and a software engineer??

        - Sofware engineer may be a broader term than developer
        - Development one part of the process
        - Software engineering starts before development
        
    - Diane Panagiotopoulos
        What is software engineering??
    
        - Software engineering, development, and programming can mean different things depending on who you ask

        What is the difference between a software developer and a software engineer??

        - Sometimes terms can mean very different roles
        - Software engineer can be similar to civil engineer or mechanical engineer
        - Titles can mean different roles in different countries

## Introduction to the SDLC (Software development life cycle)

### Goals

    - Systematic process to develop high-quality software
    - Aims to produce software that meets requirements
    - Defined phases with their own processes and deliverables
    - Cycle of planning, design, and development
    - Minimizes development risks and costs

### History of the SDLC

    - Conceived of in the mid-1960s
    - A deliberate approach needed to manage complex projects
    - Initially used the waterfall method
    - Adapted to use iterative methods

### Advantages of the SDLC
    
    - Improves efficiency and reduce risks
    - Team members know what they should be working on and when
    - Facilitates communication among stakeholders
    - Team members know when development can move to the next phase
    - Respond to changing requirements
    - Solve problems early in the process
    - Reduces overlapping responsibilities

### Recap

    - The SDLC provides a systematic process for software development
    - The SDLC developed because of a need for a systematic approach
    - SDLC Advantages include
        - Risk reduction and improved efficiency

## Phases of SDLC

![SDLC phases](sdlc_phases.png)

### Phase 1 - Planning

- Gathered 
- Analyzed
- Documented
- Prioritized

#### Parts to be considered

- Users of the solution
- Purpose of the solution
- Data Inputs/Outputs
- Legal and Regulatory Compliance
- Risk Identifications
- QA requirements
- Allocating Human and Finantial Resources
- Project Scheduling 

#### Prototyping

- Small-scale replica to clarify requirements
- Test design ideas
- Can be developed at various stages of the SDLC

#### Software requirements specification (SRS)

- Requirements are documented in the SRS
- All stakeholders must agree

### Phase 2 - Design

- Requirements are gathered from the SRS to develop architecture.

- Build Design Document

### Phase 3 - Development

- After Design Document is produced, the project planners use this document to assign coding tasks

- Develop process can be done securely

### Phase 4 - Testing

- Code is tested to ensure stability, security, and that it meets requirements from the SRS

- Bugs reported, tracked, fixed, and retested until the code is stable

#### Test types included

- Unit testing

- Integration Testing

- System Testing 

- Acceptance Testing

### Phase 5 - Deployment


Tested Code -> User acceptance testing environment -> Production Environment

### Phase 6: Maintenance

- Other bugs
- New and changing requirements
- Code enhancements
- User interface issues
